Data Structure

Array
1. rotate array by n position
2. find two number that add up to n
3. merge two sorted array - array(m + n extra space) and array(n)n
4. dutch flag problem - 0s 1s 2s together


Linked List
1. inserion in sorted linked list
2. deletion in sorted linked list
3. remove duplicates from sorted linked list
4. reverse a linked list - iteration
5. reverse a lionked list - recursive
6. find middle value in linked list
7. return n th node from end
8. detect a loop in linked list



Graph
1. DFS																	
2. BFS																	
3. connected nodes from a source - DFS									
4. sub graphs in graph - DFS											
5. shorted path between nodes - BFS										
6. acyclic graph - DFS													
7. bipartite graph - DFS												
8. directed - reverse a graph
9. topological sort a graph


Tree
1. tree traversal - pre
2. tree traversal - inorder
3. tree traversal - post order
4. tree traversal - level order
5. tree traversal - reverse level order



Matrix 
1. sorted matrix search
2. path counts from top to bottom - DFS	
3. path counts from top to bottom - DP	
4. path counts with hurdle from top to bottom - DFS	
5. path counts with hurdle from top to bottom - DP	
6. search a word/pattern in matrix - using DFS	
7. min/max path sum from top to bottom - using DFS
8. min/max path sum from top to bottom - using DP
